An experiment on media types and file formats.

# Update spring 2024

This section is now a separate [blog](https://vintagereality.projektemacher.org/), where previously unseen images are also provided. In addition, functionalities like a display for red-green glasses and generated depth maps, have been added.

# Update Christmas 2022

* The quality of generated wigglegrams has been massively improved by using [StereoscoPy](https://github.com/2sh/StereoscoPy). It uses OpenCV to improve the image layout. Additionally, anaglyphs can now be generated.
* The improved arrangement does not work very well with low structured content, like interiors or many plants, without horizon or without contrast.
* There are now more images online
* [MPO](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Picture_Object) files are now generated.
