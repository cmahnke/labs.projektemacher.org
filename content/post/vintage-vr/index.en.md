# Update spring 2024

This section is now a separate [blog](https://vintagereality.projektemacher.org/), where previously unseen images are also provided. In addition, functionalities like a display for red-green glasses and generated depth maps, have been added.

# Original post

The category [1900 in 3D](/future/3d/) has been greatly expanded, there are now more stereograms and more output formats (MPO, anaglyphs) are provided. And the display in a simple 3D viewer that works with a cell phone such as [Google Cardboard](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard) can now be realized via the integrated full-screen view in landscape format.

And of course there also is a good title: **Vintage Reality**
